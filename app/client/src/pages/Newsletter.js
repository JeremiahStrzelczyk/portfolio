        TEST TEST TEST TEST ! Dear TEST TEST TEST Families,
      </h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our classroom! As we work together in support of your child's
        education, it is vital that you understand how we will assess your
        child's progress. This newsletter will explain the different types of
        assessments that we use, how they will help your child learn, and how
        you can stay involved in the process.

          <p>
            These assessments help us identify your child's strengths and areas
            for growth before instruction begins. Please think of these as the
            doctor's check-up before prescribing the medicine. As an example, I
            may give a short test or ask your child questions in English about
            something to see what they can already understand. This actually
            helps me adjust my lessons to meet your child's specific needs
            (Brown and Harris, 2023).

            These are ongoing assessments during our lessons; for example,
            quizzes, class discussions, or even a thumbs up or down. They are
            related to understanding how well your child grasps the material. I
            can then and there make adjustments in my teaching. Formative
            assessment is important in that it ensures your child keeps up the
            pace of learning (Formative and Summative Assessment, 2021).

            Summative assessments are those that occur at the close of some unit
            or semester, typically as final exams or final projects, and show
            just how much your child has learned. These serve as important means
            of measuring overall progress to ensure your child has indeed met
            prescribed learning goals (Formative and Summative Assessment,
            2021).

            Our assessments align to both the ELP standards and the content
            standards. In other words, each test or quiz is checking your
            child's understanding in English to complement the concept standard
            being explicitly taught in a particular subject area, such as
            mathematics or science. Another way to think about this is that it
            is a dual focus-ensuring that your child develops language skills
            along with acquiring academic knowledge.

            The results of assessment let me know when I need to make an
            adjustment in my teaching methods and/or the classroom environment.
            In such cases, if a student has struggled with their vocabulary, I
            need to model the proper usage of the language more, or add more
            visual support to drive the point home. Assessments also assist in
            helping me determine the time needed to introduce higher-level
            activities or if a student needs additional support, such as being
            provided with after-school tutoring.

            We also encourage the students to reflect upon their learning with
            the help of learning journals and self-assessment checklists. These
            techniques make the students more aware of their strengths and
            weaknesses, thus making them independent and sure about themselves
            in this journey of learning (Rankin & Casey, 2022).
