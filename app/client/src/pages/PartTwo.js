          All educators are responsible for EL success. Arizona's approach is
          structured around four principles (Arizona Department of Education,
          n.d.)

              Student agency is the ability for students to take ownership in
              their learning by maintaining an active role. Student agency is
              essential in ELL instruction because they are having to learn core
              content in addition to English acquisition. Educators can foster
              student agency through cultural sensitivities and differentiating
              instruction in ways that allow ELLs to feel comfort in the
              classroom and digest core content (Arizona Department of
              Education, n.d.).

              The four principles of the LDA focus around the student's existing
              knowledge, learning, language development, and progress (Arizona
              Department of Education, 2024).

              This principle is about recognizing the value that each ELL brings
              with them, such as their cultural background and existing
              knowledge. Teachers use these insights to help them learn. For
              instance, teachers can incorporate cultural celebrations into the
              classroom and offer story choices in students' primary languages
              (Arizona Department of Education, 2024).
            </p>
            <p>
              Teachers are not just teaching content; they are using what
              students already know to make learning more relevant to them
              (Arizona Department of Education, 2024).
            </p>

              Families play a key role in helping their student succeed in
              English acquisition (Arizona Department of Education, 2024).

          Principle 2: Integrated Instruction in Disciplinary Language & Content

            <ul>
              <li>English Language Learning built into core subjects</li>
              <li>ELLs learn alongside non-EL peers</li>

            <p>
              This principle is about teaching language and subject content
              together, making sure that EL students are learning alongside
              their classmates. English language learning is not separated from
              core content; rather teachers integrate it into core subjects like
              math, reading, writing, and science. ELLs get needed exposure to
              the academic language necessary for them to learn the subjects EL
              students learn alongside their non-EL peers. Teachers adjust their
              teaching strategies and implementation to meet the needs of EL
              while ensuring everyone can succeed. These practices ensure that
              EL students are not left behind in content areas as they learn
              English (Arizona Department of Education, 2024).

        <h4>Principle 3: Targeted & Explicit Language Instruction</h4>

          <div className="project__column">
            <ul>

          <div className="project__column">
            <p>
              This principle is about teaching English directly to EL students
              to improve their ability to use English in mainstream classrooms.
              It focuses entirely on language development as ELL get devoted
              time working on English. Instruction is tailored to the needs of
              EL students, focusing on grammar, vocabulary, and academic
              language. Grouping students by language level allows for more
              targeted teaching (Arizona Department of Education, 2024).

              This principle is about tracking and understanding student
              progression and making necessary adjustments where needed. This is
              accomplished through formal testing, informal assessments, or
              other diagnostic tools. For instance, ELLs can take tests on their
              English grammar to measure proficiency. Alternatively, teachers
              can gauge progress through conversations or class participation.
              The data collected allow teachers to adjust their strategies to
              best support each students' needs With continuous progress
              monitoring, teachers are best prepared to ensure EL students are
              progressing in English acquisition and advancing in core content
              areas (Arizona Department of Education, 2024).

        <h3>SEI Models</h3>
        <p>
          Each model has a portion of the day designated to targeted
          instruction, which is grouped by EL, integrated instruction, which is
          ELs and non-ELs, and mainstream classrooms.

          </div>

          <div className="project__column">
            <p>
              The Pull-Out model allocates 60 minutes per day for targeted
              instruction and 60 minutes per day for integrated instruction. The
              remainder of the day is mainstream classroom time (Arizona
              Department of Education, 2024).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Two Hour model allocates 120 minutes for targeted instruction.
              It allocates the time needed to complete a content-area lesson
              during integrated instruction (Arizona Department of Education,
              2024).
            </p>
            <p>
              The Newcomer model allocates 120 minutes for targeted instruction
              and 120 minutes for integrated instruction. Integrated instruction
              differs for the Newcomer model in that it is ELs only (Arizona
              Department of Education, 2024).
            </p>
            <p>
              The 50-50 Dual Language Immersion model teaches half of the day in
              English and the other half of the day in partner language
              instruction. For half of the day, 30 minutes is allocated for
              targeted instruction, 90 minutes is allocated for integrated
              instruction, and the rest of that half is mainstream classroom
              (Arizona Department of Education, 2024).

              Principle one and principle four are implied. That is, to adhere
              to Arizona's Language Development Approach, teachers should be
              building upon their ELL's background and culture. Additionally,
              teachers should be testing for growth.

            <p>
              The SEI models incorporate principle two by allocating a portion
